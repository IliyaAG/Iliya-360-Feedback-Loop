## ℹ️ Strengths
Iliya was one of those people you could always rely on.  
His learning curve was impressive — whenever he needed to pick up something new, he stayed focused and got it done quickly.  
He handled tasks responsibly and carefully, never rushing into decisions before reviewing everything properly.  
Thanks to his solid DevOps skills (especially Docker and Kubernetes), whenever there was a technical problem, he was the first name that came to mind.  
He was responsive, polite, and easy to work with — making the whole work environment more positive and dependable.

## ℹ️ Areas for Growth
If I have to say one thing (mostly as an inside joke), it would be JavaScript 😄  
But honestly, it’s not really a weakness — more like one of those friendly jokes between teammates.

## ℹ️ Suggestions for Development
Continuing in the DevOps field is definitely the right path for him, since it’s a domain that evolves constantly and matches perfectly with his learning mindset.  
If there’s one small suggestion, it would be documenting his work more often — because what he knows could benefit others in the team, too.
