# Iliya-360-Feedback-Loop
*[english🇬🇧](README.md)*  |  *[🇮🇷فارسی](README.fa.md)*

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to get to know myself better and to record feedback from my colleagues and acquaintances throughout my career.
I hope that friends will contribute to this project and help me complete it.
❤️ Thank you in advance for your time spent on this project.❤️

### Additional notes:
  - 💯 All pull requests are merged with the project. 💯
  - ✅ Recommendations can be in markdown, html, txt, an image, or a combination of these formats or creative structures that are suitable for the GitHub environment. ✅
  - 📝 I don't make any changes to anyone's files except typos or syntax errors. 📝
  - 🌏 You can write your feedback in Persian or English or even bilingually. 🌏

### Project structure
Each contributor creates his/her own recommendation and feedback in the people directory and in a directory named after him/her. For example, Mr. **Hashem** creates his recommendation in **people/hashem/**

If you're kind enough to take the time, I'd prefer you to create and write this feedback yourself, but if needed, I've prepared a sample file that you can click on the link below to view.
